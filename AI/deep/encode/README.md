## Autoencoder for Denoising MNIST Data

This project implements an Autoencoder designed to remove noise from MNIST dataset images. Autoencoders are a type of neural network that learns efficient data encoding and is often used for dimensionality reduction or denoising tasks.

In this project, the Autoencoder is trained to reconstruct the original MNIST digits from their noisy counterparts. The network architecture consists of an encoder that compresses the input into a latent space representation and a decoder that reconstructs the clean image from this representation.

Key features of this project include:

*Data Preprocessing: The MNIST dataset is artificially corrupted with Gaussian noise to create noisy images.

*Model Architecture: The Autoencoder architecture is composed of convolutional layers, which are particularly effective in capturing spatial 
hierarchies in image data.

*Training: The model is trained using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, which penalizes the difference between the reconstructed image and the original clean image.

*Evaluation: After training, the Autoencoder effectively removes noise from the test images, providing a clear, denoised version of the MNIST digits.

This project demonstrates the power of Autoencoders in image denoising and can serve as a foundational example for more advanced image processing tasks.
