Microsoft machine learning engineers leverage Microsoft technology to translate the
raw data gathered from various data pipelines into data science models that can be
applied and scaled as needed. A machine learning engineer connects that structured
data to the models defined by the data scientists they work with. In addition, machine
learning engineers also develop algorithms and build programs that enable machines,
computers, and robots to process incoming data and identify patterns.
